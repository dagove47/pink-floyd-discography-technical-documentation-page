                    <p>Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining a following as a
                        psychedelic pop group, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic
                        experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows, and became a leading band of the
                        progressive rock genre. They are one of the most commercially successful and influential bands
                        in popular music history.</p>

                    <p>On their debut album, Pink Floyd both pioneered and refined psych-rock from the era. Syd Barrett,
                        who made only this one full album with the band he founded, pretty much dominates the songs,
                        twisting his words around equally skewed sounds and patterns. As the band moved on without him,
                        it got more ambitious, but it also lost much of its playfulness.</p>

                    <p>David Gilmour's first Pink Floyd album, and Syd Barrett's last, A Saucerful of Secrets was pieced
                        together around Barrett's deteriorating mental state. It's less cohesive than the band's debut,
                        and it often sounds like it was made by a group in transition. Following its release in 1968,
                        the core lineup settled in for bigger and grander things.</p>

                    <p>Pink Floyd's first full album without Syd Barrett doubles as a soundtrack album to a little-seen
                        movie by director Barbet Schroeder (who later made Single White Female). The music is among the
                        band's most experimental, drifting from acoustic folk songs to avant-garde noise rock. It's more
                        of a curio than an essential work in their catalog.</p>

                    <p>Another one of the many transitional albums in Pink Floyd's career, Animals marks their first
                        real political work as well as a reaction to the punk music then booming in the band's U.K.
                        homeland. The album's five pieces weave together to form one of the group's most complex and
                        textured albums. The gargantuan tour, and its many problems, inspired several of The Wall's most
                        nihilistic moments.</p>

                    <p>Roger Waters dug deep into his personal family history for his double-record masterpiece about
                        war, its toll on survivors, celebrity, isolation and getting sucked into your own head. It's
                        such a fully formed and realized work that when it came time to make a 1982 movie based on The
                        Wall, most of the pieces were already in place. The band's opus ... and its breaking point.</p>

                    <p>The band's follow-up to the massively popular The Wall album is a couple of things: a sequel, or
                        prequel, to that 1979 LP, and, basically, Roger Waters' debut solo record (this is his final
                        work with the band). The Final Cut digs deeper into the war themes that shattered his childhood
                        and fueled much of The Wall. It's a bit self-indulgent at times, but it makes a fitting
                        companion piece.</p>

                        showcase Gilmour's new role as group leader.</p>

                    <p>The Division Bell marked the biggest gap between Pink Floyd albums -- seven years -- up to that
                        point. And like its predecessor, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, it sounds like a David Gilmour
                        solo record with some assist from keyboardist Richard Wright (and drummer Nick Mason). It's not
                        a bad album, but it's a long way from The Dark Side of the Moon, even with the communication
                        theme tying it all together.</p>

                    <p>The Endless River, which was released 20 years after the last Pink Floyd album, consists mostly
                        of outtakes from 1994's The Division Bell. Keyboardist Richard Wright died in 2008, and the
                        record often plays like a tribute to him. The songs are almost ambient pieces, many based around
                        Wright, with few ties to the band's classic period. Following its release in 2014, Pink Floyd
                        called it quits.</p>
